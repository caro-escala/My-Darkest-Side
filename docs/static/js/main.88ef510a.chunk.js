Artist Nadine Jarvis has the amazing idea of using carbon from corpses someted to cremation to make pencils. 240 pencils can be done from a regular size dead body. Do the maths! Plenty of sagas could be written! Of course, they wouldn't be your 'brain child' but some contribution should be aknowlegded to you, big-hearted dead person!

Unknowingly, I learnt a lot, and I guess that marked my adult life. During the social aisolation I decided to do a proper course in forensic science and I studied evisceration techniques, the manner of death, the signs of violence due to different agressions and wounds, how to discriminate between a murdering beheading or a suicidal one... My personal interest in the matter had gone beyond TV series and books, and finally I found myself enjoying the review of the autopsy file of famouse people, trying to make questions to the case, to figure it out what had happened... But to be honest, I felt crazy about knowing some details as how much weigthed somebody's liver, for instance.",url:"./post2.jpg",intro:"Novels about crimes wasn't enough.

Anyways, I kept her near my heart while I cried disconsolately for a while. We didn't have a garden to bury her, and I didn't want to ask family or friends for a piece of land for leaving this 'gift' there. So, I remembered a you tube video made by my favorite mortician (that means that I follow more than one, yes) about her cat's death. I definitely needed more time to process that lost, so, I provided me for time. I told my husband not to ask questions, I made a bed with my T-Shirt pijama in a bowl of ice-cream and put Cobi gentily there. Then to the fridge, until I felt ready for say Goodbye forever. Every single day, my husband and I would open the fridge to choose something to cook and would be reminded that our little girl was gone.",url:"./post3.jpg",intro:"With frozen pizza, meal and ice cream..."},f={id:"post4",titulo:"Composting our soul",text:"With too much luck, we are going to be able to compost our body after death.
