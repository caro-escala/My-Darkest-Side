My personal interest in the matter had gone beyond TV series and books, and finally I found myself enjoying the review of the autopsy file of famouse people, trying to make questions to the case, to figure it out what had happened...

So, I remembered a you tube video made by my favorite mortician (that means that I follow more than one, yes) about her cat's death. I definitely needed more time to process that lost, so, I provided me for time. I told my husband not to ask questions, I made a bed with my T-Shirt pijama in a bowl of ice-cream and put Cobi gentily there. Then to the fridge, until I felt ready for say Goodbye forever.
